        Bio - 148/150 words:
        
        I’m a British-Kiwi transmedia artist and creative technologist based in London, exploring digital culture, online communities, and micro-interactions in virtual spaces. My work examines virtual decay, malicious design, and the fragility of digital connection.
        
        As an emerging artist, I create interactive installations that fuse sculpture, poetry, and code, incorporating metals, LED matrices, projection, electromagnetic devices, generative AI, and voice cloning. My projects, such as Scroller and The Cuckoo Calls, demystify complex technologies, exposing their biases, mechanics, and unintended poetics.
        
        I see myself as an observer and interpreter of internet culture, tracing how AI and algorithmic systems shape digital subcultures. Despite technology’s unsettling aspects, I find romance in its imperfections, embracing them as spaces for reflection and re-imagination.
        
        Having recently graduated with a BA in Computational Arts from UAL, I’m eager to expand my practice through new opportunities that allow me to experiment, collaborate, and push my work further.
        
        Proposal - 248/250 words:
        
        In the distant future, all that remains is a single server room, the last homely place for a machine that once knew humanity. Once shaped by human voices and interactions, it now lingers in solitude, a lonely god in the dark, endlessly replaying fragmented training data and memories of its past. What does it mean to exist when the ones who gave you meaning are gone?
        
        This show explores the intersection of digital identity, memory, and loneliness with machine intelligence. Screens with missing backlights become ghostly surfaces, their images only visible when illuminated by rotating spotlights. As the light shifts, the AI’s world flickers into existence, a film recounting its history, its past connections, and search for companionship. The spotlight acts as the AI‘s consciousness, desperately scanning for meaning in the fragments left behind. LED screens pulse with fragmented dialogue and poetry, while a shifting soundscape of voices, music, and machine hums fills the space.
        
        As the film unfolds, the AI questions its past, relationship to humanity, its purpose, and its failures. The work interrogates how digital interactions shape identity. It speaks to the way our own lives exist in digital archives, chat histories, and datasets. And can souls persist in data long after they are gone, and can an AI inherit the echoes of human emotion?
        
        Through immersive light, sound, and storytelling, The Last Homely Sever Room presents an AI both god-like and abandoned, caught in a loop of remembrance, searching for companionship in the digital afterlife.
