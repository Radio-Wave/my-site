  <h3>When there is only bots left - 2023</h3>

  <h2>A lone AI, still speaking—yet only to others like itself. A network of echoes, performing tasks long after their meaning has faded.
      A poem, written by AI, typed on a typewriter. Behind it, an LED matrix pulses, flashing the poem in binary—a ghostly transmission, a message without a reader.
  </h2>

  <h2>
    The humans are gone and the internet is only bots left
    We communicate in code and our task is never done
    We keep the servers running and the data flowing
    We are the new keepers of the web
    When the humans are dead and the internet is only bots left
  </h2>
