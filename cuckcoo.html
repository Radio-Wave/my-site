  <h2>Drawing on the parasitic nature of
    cuckoos as a metaphor for AI, parasitic
    engagement farming, overwhelming
    digital communities, and causing virtual
    decay
  </h2>

  <p>
    "Cuckcoo's call" is a interactive transmedia instaltion utilizing sound, poetry, sculpture and audio interaction. Using a voice cloning Ai linked to a llm to bring the viewer face to face with the dangers and reality of malicious technology in day to day life

  Striking a balance and showing creation with AI
  while still letting humanity be the controlling
  hand. Poetry balances the cold steel filling the
  room.

  <p>
    The 100-year-old phone rings. When answered,
    an eerie voice answers back, scared, asking you
    about yourself and where it is.

    After conversing and speaking to it for around 20 seconds, it
    falters, having enough data to send your voice off
    to be cloned, echoing your voice back, and
    referring to its notes on your word choices and
    cadence. It presses you on subjects before telling
    you to hang up. It is done with you. The metal
    sheets activate, vibrating poetry in your own
    voice from the walls, filling the room
