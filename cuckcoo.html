  <h3>Cuckcoo Calls - 2024</h3>

  <h2>Drawing on the parasitic nature of
    cuckoos as a metaphor for AI, parasitic
    engagement farming, overwhelming
    digital communities, and causing virtual
    decay</h2>

  <p>
  Striking a balance and showing creation with AI
  while still letting humanity be the controlling
  hand. Poetry balances the cold steel filling the
  room.
  The 100-year-old phone rings. When answered,
  an eerie voice answers back, scared, asking you
  about yourself and where it is. After conversing
  and speaking to it for around 20 seconds, it
  falters, having enough data to send your voice off
  to be cloned, echoing your voice back, and
  referring to its notes on your word choices and
  cadence. It presses you on subjects before telling
  you to hang up. It is done with you. The metal
  sheets activate, vibrating poetry in your own
  voice from the walls, filling the room</p>
