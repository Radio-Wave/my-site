       <h2>Drawing on the parasitic nature of
    cuckoos as a metaphor for AI, parasitic
    engagement farming, overwhelming
    digital communities, and causing virtual
    decay
  </h2>

  <p>
    "Cuckoo's call" is a interactive transmedia instaltion utilizing sound, poetry, sculpture and audio interaction. Using a voice cloning Ai linked to a llm to bring the viewer face to face with the dangers and reality of malicious technology in day to day life

  Striking a balance and showing creation with AI
  while still letting humanity be the controlling
  hand. Poetry balances the cold steel filling the
  room.
  </p>


  <p>
    The 100-year-old phone rings. When answered,
    an eerie voice answers back, scared, asking you
    about yourself and where it is.

    After conversing and speaking to it for around 20 seconds, it
    falters, having enough data to send your voice off
    to be cloned, echoing your voice back, and
    referring to its notes on your word choices and
    cadence. It presses you on subjects before telling
    you to hang up. It is done with you. The metal
    sheets activate, vibrating poetry in your own
    voice from the walls, filling the room

  The Cuckoo gormed for this mimic, their own kin denied.
  They turn bulimic
  Do the parents know their error,
  of what they left behind?
  Praising their chicks' plump body. Hubris. Pride.
  Watch them forfeit their future, as their own offspring die, Loving an egg into a tumour - a timebomb in disguise.
  Will the mimic mourn its parents when even its birth had been a lie?
  When it had watched the missing egg hunts. wait till he flies. Jekyll and Hyde.
  Can we really blame the
  But sometimes to save the nest you've got to wave an egg goodbye.
  Do you truly comprehend? Death in the sky! Get them inside!
  Mabye im not being explicit.
  So I might tone back the euphemism, or you might miss it.
  Because some scraps are reminiscent
  Of these apps we use relax/keep track/keep tapping - it's illicit. like how they use our data to track us, (Complicit?) Do we know how this impacts us.
  In dierts oy digate sold to digitar pee actors,
  In digits
  Bankers, hackers, manufactures, Track us, trick us and map us.
  While algorithms grow fat on we unwittingly provide.
  Feeding on our lives, unguarded, and in broud daylight.
  Do we realise the error in the ways we've complied.
  Praising of this scrolling endless supply.
  Consumption becomes its function,

  As we stand
  We're at a junction.
  Do we get abducted by the seduction
  Do get abducted by the secuction or sadiction,

  Thinking machines that are an assumption of you, a reconstruction of me.
  The introduction of ai.
  Scienceffiction told us they would malfunction.
  Weaponise there functions
  and come
  And flatten london.
  seize their own means of production.
  What they truly do is much less enthralling.
  Churn out post after post with no heed to their calling.
  The dedonstruction of forums, blogs, leading to stalling.
  Our thoughts and discussions, minds now sprawling.
  Feeding fake photos to fraud viewers.
  Manipulate, assimilate only to replicate.
  Misleading
  takes only reward computers.
  Simulate to discriminate only to accelerate.
  It's more than minor, this digltal basket we trust,

  We ignore the decay, our basket of eggs turned to dust
