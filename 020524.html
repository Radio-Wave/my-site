       <h2>Poetry recontextualised exactly one year after being written during a thunderstorm on 2/5/24—reimagined through historical lightning strike data, mapped precisely onto London as it occurred that day.
  </h2>

  <p>
    Continuing practice with LED panels, and poetry, this retropsectivce is a way of editing poems, rarther then changing the words, keeping the exact snapshot of the writing, and instain akin to a burning haibun display segements only.

    For this the panels, a map of the thames is displayed, posisioned in Milbank Tower so that the thames is clear in view behind it
